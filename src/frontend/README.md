This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

### First-Time Deployment

1. **Sign up for Vercel**: Create an account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one.

   - Choose "Import Git Repository"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

4. **Environment Variables**:
